## AluraBooks: Landing Page - Mobile First

Hello! 👋 This is my project of a landing page for Alura Books, an online store of programming books. 📚💻
The focus of this project was the use of the mobile-first methodology for the development of HTML and CSS. This means that the page was structured thinking first about the user experience on mobile devices, with responsiveness for larger screens.

## What you find on the page:

- **Bestsellers Section**: Shows the most popular programming books on the platform, with a brief description and user reviews. 🏆
- **Search Section**: Allows the user to search for specific books using keywords. 🔍
- **Shopping Section**: Facilitates navigation between books, with buttons to add to the wish list and buy. 🛒
